This is the initial version of the arxiv retriever and summariser. It is built with Ollama, Llama3.2 and Gradio. It is built locally. 

The inputs are the topic, dates, and output type (PDF or Markdown). 

The application will fetch and summarise the papers and return a table of the fetched papers along with the output file (PDF or Markdown).
